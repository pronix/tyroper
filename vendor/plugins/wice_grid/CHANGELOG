=== 8/10/2008

New view helper parameter <tt>:sorting_dependant_row_cycling</tt> - When set to true (by default it is false) the row styles +odd+ and +even+
will be changed only when the content of the cell belonging to the sorted column changes. In other words, rows with identical values in the
ordered column will have the same style (color).

=== 3/10/2008

For simple columns like

  g.column :column_name => 'Username', :attribute_name => 'username'  do |account|
    account.username
  end

the following blockless shortcut can be used:

  g.column :column_name => 'Username', :attribute_name => 'username'

In this case +attribute_name+ will be used as the method name to send to the ActiveRecord instance.

		g.row_attributes{ |portal_application|
			{:id => "#{@portal_applications_grid.name}_row_#{portal_application.id}"}
		}

		g.column{ |portal_application| ... }
		g.column{ |portal_application| ... }
